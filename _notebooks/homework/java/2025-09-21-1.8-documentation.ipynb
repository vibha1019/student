    "\n",
    "In team projects, **documentation ensures clarity and consistency** across developers. Team members often work on different parts of the same codebase, so clear Javadoc helps others understand the purpose, parameters, and logic of your methods without needing to ask or read through the entire implementation.  \n",
    "It also helps new team members onboard faster and prevents bugs caused by misunderstandings of how methods are supposed to behave.\n",
