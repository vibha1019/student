# Sprint 2 Individual Review

## Reflection on Sprint 1
In the first sprint, I focused on two major areas of growth:
- **Full-Stack Development:** I learned how to connect the frontend and backend by creating a plant feature using a Spring backend. This gave me hands-on experience with full-stack integration.  
- **Lesson Design:** I developed lessons that effectively applied all six layers of the learning pyramid.

## Goals for Sprint 2
For this sprint, I plan to build on what I learned and tackle more advanced tasks:
- **Backend Data Management:** Transition all data currently stored in local storage into Spring database tables. This will make the application more scalable and persistent.  
- **Improved Lesson Structure:** Apply the Gagne + Merrill instructional design philosophy. Based on post-it feedback, students found some lessons too complex. I plan to walk through lessons more clearly, ensuring they are easier to follow and more engaging.

## Personal Goals
Looking ahead, I want to:
1. Continue strengthening my backend development skills, especially database management with Spring.  
2. Improve how I present lessons by making them more interactive and easy to understand.  
3. Aim to balance technical contributions with effective teaching so I grow both as a developer and a mentor.
