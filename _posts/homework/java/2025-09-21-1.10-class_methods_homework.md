# Homework: Ultimate Battle

---

## Scenario

You are programming a game where 2 objects of your choosing (e.g., Robots, Dinosaurs, People) battle. Each object has health and power.

---

## Instructions

1. **Create a class** representing your object with:

   **Instance variables:**  
   - `String name`  
   - `int power`  
   - `int health`  
   - `MAKE YOUR OWN`

   **Static variables:**
   - `double fightDuration`

   **Instance methods:**  
   - `void attack()`
   - `void printStatus()`
   - `MAKE YOUR OWN`

   **Class methods:**  
   - `static int strongerFighter()`
   - `static void beginBattle()`
   - `MAKE YOUR OWN`

2. **In `main`:**  
   - Create two objects.  
   - Use instance methods to attack and print status.  
   - Use static methods to compare, print a fact, and start the battle.


```java
/**
 * The {@code Robot} class represents a robot fighter in an ultimate battle simulation.
 * <p>
 * Each robot has a name, power, and health, and can attack another robot.
 * The battle is tracked using static methods that determine who is stronger
 * and how long the battle lasts.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Features:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Robots can attack and take damage.</li>
 *   <li>Tracks total battle duration using a static variable.</li>
 *   <li>Static methods compare fighters and start the battle.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Example usage:</b></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * Robot r1 = new Robot("Astra", 25, 100);
 * Robot r2 = new Robot("Titan", 30, 100);
 * Robot.beginBattle(r1, r2);
 * }</pre>
