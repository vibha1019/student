Example Class:

```java
// Suppose we have a class:
public class Dog {
    private String name;
    public Dog(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " says: Woof!");
    }
}

// To use it:
Dog d = new Dog("Fido");  // create an instance
d.bark();                 // call the instance method on d
```

## Popcorn Hack #1

- Add another property to the dog class for `breed`.
- Add another method to the dog class that prints "My dog `name` is a `breed`!"
- Create a new object of this class and call the method.


```Java
// Work by Vibha Mandayam

public class Dog {
    // Properties
    private String name;
    private String breed;

    // Constructor
    public Dog(String name, String breed) {
        this.name = name;
        this.breed = breed;
    }

    // Existing method
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " says: Woof!");
    }

    // New method
    public void describe() {
        System.out.println("My dog " + name + " is a " + breed + "!");
    }

    // To use it:
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog("Luna", "Golden Retriever");
        myDog.bark();
        myDog.describe();
    }
}

Dog.main(null); // Call main to execute the code
```

    Luna says: Woof!
    My dog Luna is a Golden Retriever!


Example Class 2: 

```java
public class Counter {
    private int count;
    public void add(int x) {
        count += x;
    }
    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

// Use it:
Counter c = new Counter();
c.add(5);
int val = c.getCount();  // returns 5
```

## Popcorn Hack #2

- Add on to the previous counter class and add three more methods for subtraction, multiplication, and division.

- Call all five methods outside of the class.


```Java
// Work by Vibha Mandayam

public class Counter {
    private int count;

    // Add method
    public void add(int x) {
        count += x;
    }

    // Subtract method
    public void subtract(int x) {
        count -= x;
    }

    // Multiply method
    public void multiply(int x) {
        count *= x;
    }

    // Divide method
    public void divide(int x) {
        if (x != 0) {
            count /= x;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
        }
    }

    // Getter method
    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }

    // Main method to test all operations
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter c = new Counter();

        c.add(10);          // count = 10
        c.subtract(3);      // count = 7
        c.multiply(2);      // count = 14
        c.divide(7);        // count = 2
        c.add(5);           // count = 7

        System.out.println("Final count: " + c.getCount());
    }
}

Counter.main(null); // Call main to execute the code
```

    Final count: 7

## MC Hacks

### Question 1

Consider the following class:
```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;
    
    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        balance = initialBalance;
    }
    
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }
    
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

Which of the following code segments will compile without error:

A)
```java
BankAccount.deposit(50.0);
double total = BankAccount.getBalance();
```

B)
```java
BankAccount account = new BankAccount(100.0);
account.deposit(50.0);
double total = account.getBalance();
```

C)
```java
BankAccount account = new BankAccount(100.0);
double total = account.deposit(50.0);
```

D)
```java
BankAccount account;
account.deposit(50.0);
double total = account.getBalance();
```

E)
```java
double total = getBalance();
BankAccount account = new BankAccount(total);
```

### Question 2

What is printed as a result of executing the following code?

```java
public class Rectangle {
    private int length;
    private int width;
    
    public Rectangle(int l, int w) {
        length = l;
        width = w;
    }
    
    public int getArea() {
        return length * width;
    }
    
    public void scale(int factor) {
        length *= factor;
        width *= factor;
    }
}

Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(3, 4);
rect.scale(2);
System.out.println(rect.getArea());
```

A) 12

B) 24

C) 48

D) 96

E) Nothing is printed; the code does not compile

### Question 3

Which of the following best describes when a `NullPointerException` will occur when calling an instance method?

A) When the method is declared as `void`

B) When the method is called on a reference variable that has not been initialized to an object

C) When the method's parameters do not match the arguments provided

D) When the method is called from outside the class

E) When the method attempts to return a value but is declared as `void`

### Question 4

Which of the following code segments will NOT compile?
```java
public class Temperature {
    private double celsius;
    
    public Temperature(double c) {
        celsius = c;
    }
    
    public double getFahrenheit() {
        return celsius * 9.0 / 5.0 + 32;
    }
    
    public void setCelsius(double c) {
        celsius = c;
    }
}
```

A)
```java
Temperature temp = new Temperature(0);
System.out.println(temp.getFahrenheit());
```

B)
```java
Temperature temp = new Temperature(100);
temp.setCelsius(25);
```

C)
```java
Temperature temp = new Temperature(20);
double f = temp.getFahrenheit();
```

D)
```java
Temperature temp = new Temperature(15);
int result = temp.setCelsius(30);
```

E)
```java
Temperature temp = new Temperature(0);
temp.setCelsius(100);
double f = temp.getFahrenheit();
```

### Question 5

Consider the following class:
```java
public class Book {
    private String title;
    private int pages;
    
    public Book(String t, int p) {
        title = t;
        pages = p;
    }
    
    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }
    
    public int getPages() {
        return pages;
    }
    
    public void addPages(int additional) {
        pages += additional;
    }
}
```

Assume that the following code segment appears in a class other than Book:

```java
Book novel = new Book("Java Basics", 200);
novel.addPages(50);
/* missing code */
```

Which of the following can replace /* missing code */ so that the value 250 is printed?

A) `System.out.println(pages);`

B) `System.out.println(novel.pages);`

C) `System.out.println(Book.getPages());`

D) `System.out.println(novel.getPages());`

E) `System.out.println(getPages());`

## Homework: Assignment Overview

**Due:** 10/16/2025  
**Points:** 1

In this assignment, you'll demonstrate your understanding of instance methods by creating a `Student` class that tracks grades and calculates statistics. You'll practice creating student objects, adding grades, calculating averages, and generating grade reports—all using instance methods that operate on each student's individual data.

## Requirements
Your program must include:
- A `Student` class with at least 3 instance variables (name, total points, number of assignments)
- A constructor that initializes the student's name and sets initial values
- At least 2 void instance methods that modify the student's grades (`addGrade`, `printReport`)
- At least 2 non-void instance methods that return calculated values (`getAverage`, `getLetterGrade`)
- A main method that creates at least 2 Student instances and demonstrates all methods working independently

## Homework Hack: Student Grade Tracker

Create a `Student` class that manages a student's grades throughout a semester.

**Required Instance Variables:**
- `String name` - the student's name
- `int totalPoints` - sum of all grade points earned
- `int numAssignments` - count of assignments completed

**Required Instance Methods:**
- `addGrade(int points)` - void method that adds a grade and updates totals
- `getAverage()` - returns the student's current average as a double
- `getLetterGrade()` - returns a String letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on average
- `printReport()` - void method that displays a formatted report of the student's performance

**Grading Scale:**
- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- F: below 60

## Sample Output

Here's an example of what your output should look like:

```
=== Student Grade Tracker System ===

Creating student: Emma Rodriguez
Student created successfully!

--- Adding Grades for Emma ---
Adding grade: 95 points
Adding grade: 88 points
Adding grade: 92 points
Adding grade: 85 points

--- Emma's Grade Report ---
Student Name: Emma Rodriguez
Total Points: 360
Assignments Completed: 4
Current Average: 90.0
Letter Grade: A
Status: Excellent work!

========================================

Creating student: James Wilson
Student created successfully!

--- Adding Grades for James ---
Adding grade: 78 points
Adding grade: 82 points
Adding grade: 75 points

--- James's Grade Report ---
Student Name: James Wilson
Total Points: 235
Assignments Completed: 3
Current Average: 78.33
Letter Grade: C
Status: Keep working hard!

========================================

Final Summary:
Emma Rodriguez - Average: 90.0 (A)
James Wilson - Average: 78.33 (C)
```

## Submission Instructions
Create a section on your personal blog documenting your completed Student Grade Tracker. Insert the rubric provided below and self-grade yourself with comments as to why you think you deserved that grade. Add screenshots/proof of your code as proof that you fulfilled all the rubric requirements in your blog along with a screenshot of the output (similar to the one provided above). 

After updating your blog, please submit a personal blog link of your completed assignment to the google form link inserted in the 'CSA Sign Up Sheet - Team Teach - Trimester 1' spreadsheet.

## Grading Rubric

| Criteria | Percent Weight | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Functionality** | 40% | Program runs without errors, creates multiple Student objects, correctly adds grades, calculates averages, and assigns letter grades |
| **Method Implementation** | 30% | Includes all required methods (addGrade, getAverage, getLetterGrade, printReport) that properly access/modify instance variables |
| **Code Quality** | 20% | Clean code with meaningful variable names, proper constructor, and helpful comments explaining method purposes |
| **Output & Presentation** | 10% | Clear, well-formatted output showing multiple students with different grades and formatted reports |

## Tips for Getting Started
- Review the Counter example from the lesson notes—your Student class will work similarly
- Start by creating the Student class with the three instance variables
- Write your constructor to initialize the name and set totalPoints and numAssignments to 0
- Implement `addGrade()` first—it should add to totalPoints and increment numAssignments
- Test each method before moving to the next one
- Remember: Test your hack multiple times and add updates in small increments in case you run into an error

## Tips for Success
1. **Start simple** - Get your constructor and `addGrade()` working first before tackling calculations
2. **Watch for division** - When calculating average, make sure to cast to double: `(double)totalPoints / numAssignments`
3. **Test with multiple students** - Create at least 2 Student objects with different grades to show independence
4. **Comment your code** - Explain what each method does, especially your letter grade logic

## Bonus Challenges (Optional for Extra Credit)
Want to go above and beyond? Try adding:
- A `getHighestGrade()` method that tracks and returns the best individual grade (you'll need to store individual grades, not just the total)
- A `getLowestGrade()` method for the lowest individual grade
- A `dropLowestGrade()` method that removes the lowest grade from calculations
- A `compareTo(Student other)` method that compares two students' averages
- Weighted grades—allow some assignments to be worth more points than others
- A `reset()` method that clears all grades and starts fresh
- Error checking to prevent negative grades or invalid input

**Good luck!**
