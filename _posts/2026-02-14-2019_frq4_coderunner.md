## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- **Randomness and probability:** Used `Math.random()` to assign each light a 40% chance of being on.
- **2D array traversal:** Used nested loops to access every row and column in the grid.
- **Column processing:** Traversed a single column to count how many lights were on.
- **Conditional logic:** Applied different rules depending on whether the light was on or off.
- **Boolean logic and modulus:** Used `% 2` and `% 3` to check evenness and divisibility.

## Reflection
This problem helped me practice working with two-dimensional arrays and carefully applying rules based on position. I had to translate written conditions into precise code while keeping track of rows, columns, and counts.

### What Made This Challenging
- Remembering that counting a column means looping through **rows**, not columns.
- Making sure the current light was included in the count.
- Correctly applying different rules depending on whether the light was on or off.
- Avoiding logic mistakes when checking even vs divisible-by-three conditions.

## Key Takeaways
- In 2D arrays, rows and columns must be handled differently.
- Counting problems should usually be solved first before applying conditions.
- Modulus `%` is essential for even and divisibility checks.
- Writing clear step-by-step logic prevents mistakes in multi-rule problems.
