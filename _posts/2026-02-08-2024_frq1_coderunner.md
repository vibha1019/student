## Code Solution for Part A and B
```java
public class Feeder
{
    // Instance variable
    private int currentFood;

    /**
     * Simulates one day with numBirds birds or possibly a bear at the bird feeder.
     * Precondition: numBirds > 0
     */
    public void simulateOneDay(int numBirds)
    {
        // 5% chance of a bear
        if (Math.random() < 0.05)
        {
            currentFood = 0;
        }
        else
        {
            // Each bird eats 10–50 grams (inclusive)
            int gramsPerBird = (int)(Math.random() * 41) + 10;
            int totalConsumed = gramsPerBird * numBirds;

            if (totalConsumed > currentFood)
            {
                currentFood = 0;
            }
            else
            {
                currentFood -= totalConsumed;
            }
        }
    }

    /**
     * Returns the number of days birds or a bear found food to eat at the feeder.
     * Preconditions: numBirds > 0, numDays > 0
     */
    public int simulateManyDays(int numBirds, int numDays)
    {
        int daysWithFood = 0;

        for (int day = 0; day < numDays; day++)
        {
            // Stop early if feeder is empty
            if (currentFood == 0)
            {
                break;
            }

            // Food was available at the start of the day
            daysWithFood++;

            simulateOneDay(numBirds);
        }

        return daysWithFood;
    }
}
``` 

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- **Randomness and probability:** Used `Math.random()` to model a 5% chance of a bear and a 95% chance of birds.
- **Control structures:** Used `if` statements and `for` loops to control program flow.
- **Encapsulation:** Updated an instance variable (`currentFood`) inside class methods.
- **Method interaction:** Used one method (`simulateOneDay`) inside another (`simulateManyDays`).
- **Stopping conditions:** Ended the simulation early when the feeder became empty.

## Reflection
This problem helped me practice writing methods that follow a detailed specification. I had to carefully translate word descriptions into code while making sure the logic matched the exact requirements.

### What Made This Challenging
- Making sure the random values were in the correct range.
- Remembering to count days only when food was available at the start of the day.
- Handling the case where the feeder becomes empty and stopping the simulation early.
- Writing code that works without a `main` method in the Code Runner environment.

## Key Takeaways
- Always read the problem carefully and follow the wording exactly.
- Random number ranges must be checked carefully to avoid off-by-one errors.
- Break conditions are important when a simulation should stop early.
- Clear, step-by-step logic makes complex problems easier to solve.
