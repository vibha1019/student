## Compare yourself to the beginning of the year

At the beginning of the year, I did not know any Java or how to make a Spring Boot project. Through this project, I learned how to make a full stack frontend-backend project with Java and gained hands-on experience with REST APIs and client-server communication.

## Remember key things from 3 sprints: Tools, Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python, Profile/LinkedIn quest.

### Tools
- **VSCode**: Set up my development environment and learned to work with Java extensions and integrated debugging tools
- **GitHub**: Learned version control practices including commits, push/pull operations, and team collaboration through repositories
- **Spring Boot**: Configured backend server architecture and learned about REST APIs, endpoints, and request/response handling
- **Postman**: Used to test API endpoints during development and debug backend functionality

### Fundamentals of JavaScript/Python
- **JavaScript**: Worked extensively with JavaScript for frontend development, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and the fetch API
- **Java**: Learned object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, objects, methods, and data structures
- **API Integration**: Connected frontend JavaScript to Java Spring Boot backend using RESTful endpoints and handled JSON data parsing
- **Full Stack Development**: Understood how frontend and backend communicate and work together in a complete application

### Profile/LinkedIn Quest
Learned how to manage a project from start to finish, including planning features, coordinating with team members, and delivering a working product.

## How N@tM went? Did you get a comment or two you liked?

## What do you want to do next on project, given time?

I liked this overarching idea of doing quest-based learning. In general, gamified learning seems like a good thing to do to get people engaged and motivated. I would say we should have more creativity for next trimester's project. Maybe each group could have more freedom to innovate, and we could work on something larger and more complex rather than simple modules.

## What do you want to learn next in CompSci?

More advanced Java concepts for the AP exam, including:
- Advanced object-oriented programming (inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces)
- Data structures (ArrayLists, 2D arrays)
- Algorithm development and optimization
- More complex problem-solving strategies

## Analytics review

### GitHub Commit History
[Insert screenshot of commit history here]

### Features Implemented
- **Plant Feature**: Developed the plant growth system that tracks user progress
- **Progress Bar**: Created a visual progress tracker to show learning completion
- **Navigation Buttons**: Implemented next and previous buttons for moving between quest modules
- **Overall Layout**: Contributed to the design and structure of the user interface

### Team Collaboration
Worked collaboratively with my team throughout the development process, contributing to both frontend and backend integration.

## MCQ review, score, correction, and approach
