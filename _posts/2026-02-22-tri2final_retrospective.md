  <h3>Constructive Criticism</h3>

  <h4>UI/UX Improvements</h4>
  <p>While the foundation is strong, many users suggested improving the overall visual design and engagement level of the platform.</p>

  <h4>Color & Visual Design</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Add more colors to make the interface visually appealing</li>
    <li>Improve overall aesthetic and polish</li>
    <li>Create a stronger visual identity</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Interactivity & Engagement</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Make the UI more interactive and user-friendly</li>
    <li>Increase game-like elements (currently feels more instructional than interactive)</li>
    <li>Add stronger engagement elements — users noted a lack of “dopamine boost” moments</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Usability Issues</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Group creation process is confusing — unclear how to add strong team fits</li>
    <li>Some pages require excessive scrolling</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Bug Fixes (Critical)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Team Former feature is currently broken</li>
    <li>Other unspecified features need debugging and further investigation</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>AI Model Enhancements</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Expand AI capabilities to be more comprehensive</li>
    <li>Increase model coverage and depth</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Feature Requests</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow users to self-identify their persona (self-assessment input)</li>
    <li>Add more persona options</li>
    <li>The persona-based choice system was well received and should be expanded</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="content-block">
  <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Strong UI foundation, meaningful classroom application, solid database implementation, and an effective AI model.</li>
    <li><strong>Improvements Needed:</strong> Visual design, engagement mechanics, clearer group formation flow, and critical bug fixes.</li>
    <li><strong>Growth Opportunity:</strong> Transitioning from a functional prototype to a polished, interactive, production-ready system requires stronger UX focus, expanded AI capabilities, and thorough debugging.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This feedback was extremely valuable because it highlights that our core concept and technical foundation are strong — now the focus shifts toward refinement, engagement, and reliability. Moving forward, I plan to prioritize UI polish, interactivity enhancements, AI expansion, and structured user testing before the next presentation.</p>

  <h2>Future Goals</h2>
</div>

<div class="content-block">
  <h3>Project Vision</h3>
  <p>For Trimester 3, our focus is shifting from simply building features to intentionally studying how students learn within our system. With two CSSE classes, we will begin by defining stakeholder profiles and forming intentionally diverse teams based on work-habit personas (Technologist, Scrummer, Planner, Finisher). This will allow us to examine how different learner types interact with the platform and how team composition influences engagement and outcomes.</p>

  <p>We will launch a structured GameBuilder module as a shared starting point for both returning and new students. The goal is to evaluate and refine the instructional design — specifically reducing cognitive overload as students transition from syntax-based programming to object-based systems development. This moves our project from a tool prototype toward a research-backed instructional intervention.</p>

  <p>To support this, we will implement a mixed-methods research approach that includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Behavioral analytics (time on task, interaction rate, scroll depth, execution frequency)</li>
    <li>Likert-scale cognitive load and confidence surveys</li>
    <li>Structured microblog reflections</li>
    <li>Summative artifact analysis</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We will analyze engagement patterns by persona group to determine whether scaffolding reduces overload, whether students demonstrate systems-level reasoning, and whether GameBuilder can be introduced earlier in the course sequence. This trimester represents a controlled implementation window (March 2–6, 2026), and findings will inform iterative refinement for a larger 2027 rollout.</p>

  <p>Beyond research, we will also strengthen team coordination and platform infrastructure. Analytics leadership, submission management, and feature debugging will be clearly assigned so that the system is both stable and measurable. The long-term vision is to transform our platform into a scalable, data-informed instructional framework that meaningfully improves how computer science students transition into systems thinking.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-block">
  <h3>Learning Objectives for Next Trimester</h3>
  <p>More advanced Java concepts for the AP exam, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advanced object-oriented programming (inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces)</li>
    <li>Data structures (ArrayLists, 2D arrays)</li>
    <li>Algorithm development and optimization</li>
    <li>More complex problem-solving strategies</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Strengths</h3>
  <p>Based on the skills breakdown, I performed very strongly in analysis, tracing, and conceptual understanding:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Program Design & Data Reasoning (1.A, 1.B):</strong> 100% — Strong ability to determine appropriate designs and extract knowledge from data.</li>
    <li><strong>Procedural Abstractions (2.C):</strong> 100% — Confident writing methods and implementing procedural logic correctly.</li>
    <li><strong>Execution & Code Tracing (3.A, 3.B):</strong> 100% — Excellent at determining output and understanding statement execution order, including code with data abstractions.</li>
    <li><strong>Code Behavior & Preconditions (4.A, 4.B):</strong> 100% — Strong ability to describe how programs behave and identify required starting conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Computing Impact (5.A):</strong> 100% — Clear understanding of broader computing implications.</li>
    <li><strong>Procedural Output Analysis (3.C):</strong> 75% — Solid performance interpreting code involving methods.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Overall, my biggest strengths are code tracing, conceptual reasoning, and understanding how algorithms execute step-by-step.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-block">
  <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
  <p>The skills data highlights specific areas that need targeted improvement:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Data Abstractions (2.B) — 20%:</strong> This is my weakest area. I need more practice writing code that uses objects, ArrayLists, and class-based structures to manipulate data.</li>
    <li><strong>Algorithm Implementation (2.A) — 60%:</strong> While I understand logic conceptually, I need to improve translating that logic into correct and efficient code.</li>
    <li><strong>Error Identification & Debugging (3.D) — 50%:</strong> I should practice identifying why code will not compile or behave as intended and correcting those issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Procedural Abstraction Output (3.C) — 75%:</strong> Strengthen consistency when analyzing method calls and parameter flow.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The main pattern is that I perform better at analyzing and interpreting code than writing complex implementations involving data abstractions.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-block">
  <h3>Correction Approach</h3>
  <p>To improve in weaker skill categories, I will:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Redo missed questions and rewrite full correct solutions without looking at notes.</li>
    <li>Practice writing programs that heavily use ArrayLists, objects, and class interactions.</li>
    <li>Work on debugging exercises where I must identify compile-time and logic errors.</li>
    <li>Trace my own written code to ensure I fully understand execution flow.</li>
    <li>Time myself while coding to improve speed and efficiency under exam conditions.</li>
  </ol>

<div class="content-block">
  <h3>Action Plan for Next Trimester</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Complete focused practice on data abstraction-heavy problems (ArrayLists, objects, class relationships).</li>
    <li>Write small programs from scratch to strengthen implementation skills (Skill 2.A & 2.B).</li>
    <li>Practice debugging non-compiling code segments weekly.</li>
    <li>Continue strengthening tracing skills to maintain 100% categories.</li>
    <li>Work through FRQs that require class design and object interaction.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="content-block">
  <h3>Homework Resources for Study</h3>
  <p>I will revisit assignments involving object-oriented design, ArrayLists, and debugging exercises to directly target Skills 2.B and 3.D, ensuring my implementation skills match my strong analytical abilities.</p>
